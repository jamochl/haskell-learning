# Haskell

Functional Programming's Safety, Immutability and Math roots are incredibly
interesting! Haskell as well has unique features such as lazy computing,
generics, and a beautiful succinctness to it.

I will be following the free *Real World Haskell* by Bryan O'Sullivan, Don
Stewart, and John Goerzen.
